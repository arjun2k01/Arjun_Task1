TO DO

Q1. Weather Module – CRUD + Excel Upload with Validation & Editable Preview

Design and implement the complete Weather module with the following requirements:

A. CRUD Functionality

Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for Weather records.

B. Excel Upload Functionality

Implement an Excel upload workflow that includes:

Upload Excel File

User can upload an Excel file containing Weather data.

Preview Panel

Display all rows from the uploaded file in a preview table.

The preview panel must be editable so users can correct invalid data directly in the table.

Validation Step (Validate Button)

Provide a Validate button.

When clicked:

Validate all rows using the rules provided in the project documentation.

Highlight rows that contain errors.

Display clear error messages for each invalid row (e.g., “Row 5: Missing date”, “Row 8: Invalid meter value”).

Submit Control

Submit button remains disabled until validation passes with zero errors.

If validation passes → enable Submit.

If validation fails → keep Submit disabled and show errors.

Final Submission

Upon successful validation, save the corrected data to the database.



Q2. Meter Data Module – CRUD + Excel Upload with Validation & Editable Preview

Design and implement the complete Meter Data module with the following requirements:

A. CRUD Functionality

Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for Meter Data records.

B. Excel Upload Functionality

Implement an Excel upload workflow that includes:

Upload Excel File

User can upload an Excel file containing Meter Data.

Preview Panel

Show the uploaded data in a preview table.

Preview table must be editable so users can fix errors directly.

Validation Step (Validate Button)

Include a Validate button to check all rows.

Validation must follow the rules mentioned in the documentation.

For invalid rows:

Highlight the row in red (or similar).

Show error messages (e.g., “Row 3: Missing meter ID”, “Row 10: Invalid reading format”).

Submit Control

Submit button stays disabled until validation succeeds.

If any row fails validation → keep it disabled and show the list of errors.

Final Submission

Allow saving data only after all validation errors have been resolved.



Weather sheet validation

Daily Data Weather Validation:

1) Date & Time

Date format: DD-MMM-YY (e.g., 01-Dec-24).

Time format: HH:MM (24-hour, e.g., 09:30).

Duplicate datetime: No duplicate date+time combinations within the file.

1) 	POA Pyranometer (W/m²)

Must be ≥ 0

Must be ≤ 1500

Zeros are permitted without triggering the “continuous” rule.

2) 	GHI Pyranometer (W/m²)

Must be ≥ 0

Must be ≤ 1500

Zeros are allowed.

3) 	Albedo (Upward / Downward pyranometers) (W/m²)

Each filled cell must be ≥ 0 and ≤ 1500.

Zeros are allowed.

4) 	Module Temperature (°C)

Cannot be 0 at any time.

Must be ≥ 0 (no negatives).

5) 	Ambient Temperature (°C)

Must be ≥ 0 (no negatives).

Zeros are allowed.

6) 	Wind Speed / Rainfall / Humidity

Must be ≥ 0 (no negatives).

Zeros are valid values.

Meter Data sheet validation

Daily Data Meter Data Validation:

1. Date Format Validation 

Format: DD-MM-YYYY (e.g., 01-12-2024)

No duplicate dates allowed

2. Time Format Validation 

Start Time: HH:MM format (e.g., 09:30)

Stop Time: HH:MM format (e.g., 17:30)

Hours: 00-23, Minutes: 00-59

3. Plant Operation Data 

Each date must have either:

Start/Stop times, OR

Export/Import readings

4. Export/Import Readings

Must be numeric values

No negative readings allowed

 

Auto-Calculated Fields:

1. Plant Start Time

Logic: First time when POA Meter 1 ≥ 10 W/m²

Source: Weather data for that date

Default: "00:00" if no sufficient irradiance found

2. Plant Stop Time

Logic: Last time when POA Meter 1 > 0 and < 50 W/m²

Fallback: If not found, use last reading where POA > 0

Source: Weather data for that date

Default: "00:00" if not found

3. Total

Formula: Stop Time - Start Time

Format: HH:MM

Handles: Overnight calculations (stop time on next day)

4. Export Total

Formula: (Final Reading - Initial Reading)

Calculated for: Each Export meter

5. Import Total

Formula: (Final Reading - Initial Reading)

Calculated for: Each Import meter

6. GSS Export Total

Calculation: Sum of all export totals for GSS meters

7. GSS Import Total

Calculation: Sum of all import totals for GSS meters

8. Net Export @GSS

Formula: GSS Export - GSS Import
